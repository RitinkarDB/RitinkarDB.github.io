Hello, I'm Ritinkar Das Bhaumik / ঋতিঙ্কর দাস ভৌমিক (the name is pronounced Ree-ting-kawr Dash Bhou-mik). 

I'm a PhD Scholar and Associate Tutor at the School of Economics at the University of East Anglia at Norwich and I primarily work in the fields of decision theory, behavioural and experimental economics. I have further interests in political economy and the philosophy of economics. 

The profile picture is from Masaaki Yuasa's 'Tatami Galaxy'. I kind of look like that irl, and it also depicts my constant state of ennui. 

This website is a work in progress.
