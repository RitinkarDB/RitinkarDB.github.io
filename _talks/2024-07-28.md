Since Ellsberg's famous thought experiment established the notion of ambiguity aversion, a lot of the experimental explorations of ambiguity attitude have thrown up mixed results, notwithstanding the fact that in life, a lot of people do exhibit ambiguity seeking behaviour. I conduct an experiment to demonstrate whether or not these differences can be attributable to the choice of task in the laboratory.
